# EZBank-Version2

The Second Version of my Demo Web Page built for Network Security 300 at SecureSet

The purpose of this site is to be a sort of banking site that we can learn to exploit on an Apache Server

This version is built from scratch using Bootstrap.  Added Javascript for some functionality.

## TO DOs
1. Make sure all links work to external static pages
2. Make sure all parts of form validation work


#Optional

3. Create a User Dashboard for Valid Login (build static DB is js to test)
4. Create the Contact and About US pages for fun.
